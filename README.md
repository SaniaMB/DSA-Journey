# DSA-Journey

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning and practicing Data Structures & Algorithms using Java.

The focus is not just on solving problems, but on understanding **why** an approach works, the trade-offs involved, and how different patterns apply across problem types.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Sliding Window  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees  
- Tries  
- Backtracking  
- Graphs  
- 1D Dynamic Programming  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  

Each topic contains multiple Java implementations where I’ve explored different approaches, edge cases, and optimizations while solving problems.

## Approach
- Emphasis on fundamentals and problem-solving patterns  
- Clean, readable Java code  
- Focus on time and space complexity awareness  
- Iterative improvement rather than one-off solutions  

## Goal
To build strong algorithmic thinking, improve coding clarity, and develop the ability to explain solutions confidently in technical interviews.

This repository is continuously evolving as I learn and refine my understanding.
